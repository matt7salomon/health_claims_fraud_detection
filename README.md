# Health Insurance Fraud Detection

This notebook contains a pipeline to detect potential fraud in health insurance claims data. The primary goal is to predict whether healthcare providers are engaging in fraudulent activities based on the characteristics of insurance claims. The dataset includes various features related to patient conditions, claims, and provider behavior, which are processed and used to train machine learning models.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this notebook includes several important features related to health insurance claims, patient chronic conditions, and healthcare provider information. Each entry in the dataset represents a healthcare provider and their corresponding claims information, along with a flag indicating whether they are suspected of fraud.

### Key Features:

- **Chronic Conditions**: Indicators for various chronic conditions (e.g., Ischemic Heart Disease, Stroke, Osteoporosis) represented as categorical or binary values.
- **Financial Information**: Features like `IPAnnualReimbursementAmt` and `IPAnnualDeductibleAmt` capture annual reimbursement amounts and deductible amounts for inpatient and outpatient claims.
- **Provider ID**: Each healthcare provider is uniquely identified by a `Provider` column.
- **Fraud Label**: The `PotentialFraud` column indicates whether the provider is suspected of fraud (`Yes` or `No`), which serves as the target variable for the fraud detection model.

## Methods and Functions

### 1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**

   The notebook starts by loading raw CSV data files into pandas DataFrames. These CSV files contain healthcare provider details, claim information, and corresponding labels indicating potential fraud. The preprocessing steps involve:
   
   - **Handling Missing Data**: The dataset is checked for missing or null values, which are either filled or removed depending on their importance.
   - **Feature Extraction**: Columns related to chronic conditions and financial details are extracted and processed. The chronic conditions are categorical values, and numeric features like reimbursement amounts are used directly in the model.
   - **Label Encoding**: The `PotentialFraud` column is label-encoded, converting the `Yes`/`No` values into binary numeric values (`1` for `Yes` and `0` for `No`).

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   Several exploratory steps are taken to understand the dataset, including:
   
   - **Summary Statistics**: Descriptive statistics of the dataset are computed, such as mean, median, and distribution of the financial features.
   - **Data Visualization**: Various plots, such as histograms and bar charts, are generated to visualize the distribution of fraud vs. non-fraud cases and the relationships between chronic conditions and fraud.

### 3. **Machine Learning Pipeline**

   The notebook implements a machine learning pipeline to detect potential fraud using multiple classification algorithms. The core methods are:

   - **Train-Test Split**: The data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
   - **Feature Scaling**: Certain features are normalized or scaled to ensure that they contribute equally to the model.
   - **Model Selection**: Multiple machine learning models are tested, including decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting methods. The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics.

### 4. **Model Training and Evaluation**

   - **Cross-Validation**: The notebook applies cross-validation to prevent overfitting and to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
   - **Evaluation Metrics**: Several evaluation metrics are used to assess the performance of the model:
     - **Accuracy**: The overall percentage of correct predictions.
     - **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**: Metrics that help evaluate the trade-off between detecting fraud correctly and minimizing false positives.
     - **Confusion Matrix**: Provides insight into how many true frauds and non-fraud cases were correctly or incorrectly classified.

### 5. **Fraud Detection Model**

   The key part of this notebook is the implementation of machine learning models to detect fraud. The notebook uses a classification model to predict whether a provider is fraudulent based on the features mentioned. Various algorithms are tested, and the one with the best performance on validation data is selected as the final model.

## Fraud Detection Approach

1. **Preprocessing**: Raw data is loaded, cleaned, and preprocessed. Categorical data such as chronic conditions are encoded, and numeric features are scaled where necessary.
   
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Basic exploratory analysis is performed to understand the dataset's structure and the distribution of fraud-related features.

3. **Model Training**: Various classification models are trained on the data. The best-performing model is selected based on cross-validation and evaluation metrics.

4. **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix. These metrics provide insights into how well the model detects fraudulent providers while minimizing false positives and negatives.

## Conclusion

This notebook builds a robust pipeline to detect fraud in healthcare claims using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features related to patient chronic conditions and financial claims data, the model is able to identify potential fraudulent activity among healthcare providers. The final model is evaluated rigorously using cross-validation and multiple performance metrics to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data.
